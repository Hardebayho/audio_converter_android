# AudioConverter
This library converts audio from one format to another. It is also capable of extracting audio from a video file, but you'll have to recompile FFMPEG to add support for more audio containers. It comes bundled with the required FFMPEG libraries and also comes with a sample project to illustrate how to use the library.
